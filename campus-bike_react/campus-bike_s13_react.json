When the usage data is updated (hourly or daily), the administrator can be notified automatically, allowing for real-time tracking and reporting of bike usage. This pattern promotes a decoupled architecture where the bike usage data can be updated independently of the administrator's interface, ensuring that the system remains responsive and user-friendly.\n* Clarifying questions: What specific metrics or data points does the administrator need to track regarding bike usage? How frequently does the administrator need to receive updates on bike usage? Are there any specific conditions under which the administrator should be notified of changes in bike usage? What is the expected volume of usage data updates, and how will this impact the performance of the Observer Pattern? Are there any other stakeholders who need to be notified of bike usage changes, or is it solely the administrator?\n* Assumptions and constraints: The system can maintain a list of observers without performance degradation. The administrator's interface can handle real-time updates without user experience issues. The frequency of updates (hourly and daily) is manageable within the system's architecture.\n* QA consequences: Improved responsiveness of the system to changes in bike usage data. Enhanced user experience for the administrator through real-time notifications.\n* Risks and tradeoffs: Potential performance issues if the number of observers grows significantly. Complexity in managing the state of observers and ensuring they are updated correctly.\n* Followup decisions: Determine the specific data points to be included in the notifications to the administrator.
