Additionally, a separate timeout can be set for the user to enter the code, which will expire after 30 seconds. This pattern helps manage the timing of operations effectively, ensuring that the user experience is smooth and that expired codes do not lead to confusion or security issues.\n* Clarifying questions: What mechanisms will be in place to notify users when their verification code is about to expire? How will the system handle cases where users request a new verification code before the previous one expires? What user interface elements will be used to indicate the remaining time for entering the verification code? How will the system ensure that the verification code is securely transmitted to the user? What logging or monitoring will be implemented to track the usage and expiration of verification codes?\n* Assumptions and constraints: The system has the capability to implement and manage timeouts effectively. Users will have access to the verification code via SMS or email in a timely manner. The application will have a reliable mechanism for tracking and validating the expiration of codes.\n* QA consequences: Improved user experience by providing clear feedback on code validity and expiration. Enhanced security by ensuring that expired codes cannot be used for authentication.\n* Risks and tradeoffs: Users may experience frustration if they do not receive the verification code in time to enter it within the 30-second window. There is a risk of increased support requests from users who may not understand the timeout mechanism. Implementing timeouts may require additional resources for monitoring and managing the expiration process.\n* Followup decisions: Determine the method of sending verification codes (SMS, email, etc.). Establish a user interface design that clearly communicates the timeout status to users. Implement logging and monitoring for verification code requests and expirations.",
