It is particularly useful in systems where the read and write workloads are significantly different.\n* Clarifying questions: What is the expected volume of read operations for bike usage history? Are there any anticipated changes to the data model that would require complex command handling? How critical is the performance of the read operations in this context? What are the expected user interactions with the bike usage history feature? Is there a need for real-time updates to the bike usage history?\n* Assumptions and constraints: The primary requirement is to provide a simple read operation for bike usage history. The system is expected to handle user data in compliance with GDPR and other data protection regulations.\n* QA consequences: Increased complexity in the system architecture without significant benefits for the specific requirement. Potential performance overhead due to the separation of command and query responsibilities.\n* Risks and tradeoffs: Increased development and maintenance complexity due to the introduction of CQRS. Potential for over-engineering the solution for a simple requirement. Risk of misalignment with the actual needs of the users, leading to a less user-friendly experience.\n* Followup decisions: Consider simpler data access patterns for querying bike usage history.
