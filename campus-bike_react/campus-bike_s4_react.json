Additionally, it allows users to log out manually by clicking the logout button, providing flexibility and control over their session.\n* Clarifying questions: What mechanisms will be in place to notify users before automatic logout due to inactivity? How will the system handle ongoing transactions or processes when a user is logged out automatically? What user experience considerations have been made for the logout process? Is there a way for users to extend their session if they are still active but not interacting with the app? How will the system ensure that the logout process complies with GDPR and other data protection regulations?\n* Assumptions and constraints: Users will be informed about the idle session timeout policy during the login process. The system can track user activity accurately to determine inactivity. The logout process will not disrupt ongoing transactions or processes. The application will have a user-friendly interface to facilitate manual logout.\n* QA consequences: Improved security by reducing the risk of unauthorized access due to idle sessions. Enhanced user experience by providing a clear logout option and notifications before automatic logout.\n* Risks and tradeoffs: Users may be logged out unexpectedly if they are inactive for 15 minutes, which could lead to frustration. There may be a need for additional resources to manage session state and track user activity accurately. Balancing security with user convenience may require careful design to avoid hindering user experience.\n* Followup decisions: Implement user notifications for impending automatic logout due to inactivity. Design a user-friendly manual logout interface. Establish guidelines for session management and user activity tracking.",
