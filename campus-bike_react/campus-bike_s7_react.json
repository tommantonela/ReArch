What strategies will be implemented to handle event schema evolution over time? How will the system ensure that the audit trail meets GDPR compliance requirements?\n* Assumptions and constraints: The system will have a reliable event processing mechanism to handle events in real-time.

This approach allows the system to maintain an accurate state of bike availability while providing a clear audit trail for compliance with regulations such as GDPR. \n\nHowever, it is essential to address several considerations:\n1. **Concurrency Handling**: The system must ensure that concurrent bike rentals are managed effectively to prevent state inconsistencies.\n2. **Event Processing Order**: Mechanisms should be in place to guarantee that events are processed in the correct sequence.\n3. **Event Storage and Retrieval**: A scalable storage solution for historical events must be established.\n4. **Event Schema Evolution**: Strategies for managing changes to the event schema over time should be defined.\n5. **GDPR Compliance**: The audit trail must meet all necessary compliance requirements.\n\nThe implementation will require a reliable event processing mechanism and the expertise to manage the complexities of an event-sourced architecture.
