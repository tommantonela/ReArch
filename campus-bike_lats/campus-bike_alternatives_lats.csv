These patterns were chosen for their ability to provide real-time updates and decoupled communication, which are essential for the requirement that allows the bike administrator to view all bikes as available or under utilization. The design assumes a robust infrastructure is in place to support real-time data transmission, while also acknowledging potential complexities in implementation. The reflection indicates that the thought process is logical and relevant, scoring an 8 out of 10, but notes that a final decision on the specific pattern to implement is still pending, which affects the completeness of the solution. This design choice positively impacts the system's responsiveness and scalability but introduces risks related to message ordering and performance under high load. Additional follow-up decisions will be necessary to finalize the pattern selection and address these risks."
S13,The administrator must be able to do a hourly and daily usage of the bikes.,0,"The design solution employs the Application metrics pattern to effectively track and report hourly and daily bike usage, aligning well with the requirement for administrators to monitor bike rentals. This pattern facilitates the collection and aggregation of usage data, enabling visualization and analysis of key performance indicators such as rental frequency and duration. While the decision to implement this pattern is appropriate, it introduces additional infrastructure complexity for metrics collection and monitoring, which could impact system performance. The reflection scores the solution a 9 out of 10, acknowledging its strong alignment with the requirement but noting that it lacks a comprehensive discussion of potential implementation challenges and alternatives. Assumptions include the availability of resources for the additional infrastructure, while trade-offs involve balancing complexity against the benefits of enhanced data insights. Follow-up decisions will be necessary to address these implementation challenges and ensure the system's scalability and reliability."
S13,The administrator must be able to do a hourly and daily usage of the bikes.,1,"The design solution employs the Data Aggregation Pattern to fulfill the requirement for hourly and daily bike usage reporting. This pattern facilitates efficient data collection and summarization, allowing the system to provide comprehensive reports on bike usage. The decision to implement this pattern is appropriate, as it directly addresses the need for data aggregation while enhancing performance by minimizing the volume of data processed at once. However, the design assumes that the existing system can accommodate the additional complexity of data handling, which may pose risks related to processing power and integration challenges. The reflection indicates a strong alignment with the requirements, scoring 9 out of 10, but notes that further implementation details and integration strategies are necessary to fully realize the solution. Additional follow-up decisions will be required to ensure seamless integration of the Data Aggregation Pattern into the current architecture."
S13,The administrator must be able to do a hourly and daily usage of the bikes.,2,"The design solution employs the Monitoring and Logging pattern to fulfill the requirement that the administrator must be able to perform hourly and daily usage reporting of bikes. This decision is grounded in the assumption that the system can log usage data without compromising performance and complies with data protection regulations. The design enhances visibility into bike usage patterns, which supports informed decision-making, although it may introduce performance overhead due to logging activities. Potential risks include data overload, which could hinder meaningful insights, and a trade-off between the granularity of logged data and system performance. Follow-up decisions are necessary to define specific metrics for logging, select appropriate monitoring tools, and establish data retention policies. The reflection indicates that while the design is appropriate and scores an 8 out of 10, it lacks completeness due to pending implementation details and metrics."
S13,The administrator must be able to do a hourly and daily usage of the bikes.,3,"The design solution for enabling the administrator to perform hourly and daily usage reporting of bikes employs the Analytics and Reporting pattern, which is well-suited for collecting and analyzing data to generate insightful reports. This decision follows an exploration of various design patterns, including the Observer Pattern, which was deemed less effective for detailed reporting. The solution assumes an object-oriented design approach and acknowledges the need for additional implementation efforts to establish data collection mechanisms. While the design effectively addresses the requirement, it introduces potential trade-offs, such as increased complexity and resource demands for setting up analytics tools. The reflection indicates a score of 8, highlighting that while the thought process is on track, a final decision is still pending, suggesting further refinement is necessary to fully satisfy the requirement. Additional follow-up decisions will be needed to finalize the implementation details and ensure comprehensive reporting capabilities."
S13,The administrator must be able to do a hourly and daily usage of the bikes.,4,"The design solution focuses on utilizing the Application metrics and Distributed tracing patterns to effectively track and report hourly and daily bike usage, addressing the requirement for usage metrics. The Application metrics pattern allows for centralized reporting and visualization of usage data, which supports data-driven decision-making, although it introduces additional infrastructure complexity. Meanwhile, the Distributed tracing pattern enhances the understanding of request flows across microservices, providing insights into performance metrics, albeit with potential performance overhead. The design is appropriate for the target requirements, assuming a robust infrastructure is in place to support these patterns. The reflection indicates a score of 8, acknowledging the relevance of the chosen patterns but noting that a final decision has not yet been made, which impacts the completeness of the solution. Follow-up decisions will be necessary to finalize the implementation details and address any potential trade-offs related to system performance and complexity."
