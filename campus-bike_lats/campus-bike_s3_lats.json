            "answer": "Observation: Initial design decision for requirement 'The biker must be able to login to the app via their email and password or by using their biometric thumb-impression. The login module must flush out user thumb impression as soon as the user has been able to login.': Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - The requirement specifies that users must be able to log in using either their email and password or a biometric thumb impression. This aligns perfectly with the concept of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), which allows for multiple methods of authentication. By implementing MFA, the system can provide a secure login process that includes both traditional credentials (email and password) and a biometric factor (thumb impression). Additionally, the requirement to flush out the user's thumb impression after login can be managed within the MFA framework, ensuring that sensitive biometric data is not stored longer than necessary.",
