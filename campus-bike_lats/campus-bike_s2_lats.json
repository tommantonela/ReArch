If the code is not entered within 30 seconds it is expired.': Decision: Timeout Management pattern - The Timeout Management pattern is used to handle timeouts in distributed systems, ensuring that operations do not hang indefinitely and that resources are released appropriately. It involves setting time limits on operations and defining actions to take when those limits are exceeded.\n* Clarifying questions: What specific operations are we considering for timeout management in relation to the verification code? How will the system handle the expiration of the verification code after 30 seconds? What mechanisms are in place to ensure that the verification code is sent successfully within the required time frame? Are there any user experience considerations for handling expired codes? What fallback mechanisms are in place if the SMS or email service fails to deliver the verification code?\n* Assumptions and constraints: The system must ensure timely delivery of the verification code within the specified time limits. The verification code must be securely generated and stored to prevent unauthorized access. The system must comply with relevant data protection regulations when handling user data.\n* QA consequences: The system may experience delays in user verification if the timeout management is not properly implemented, leading to user frustration. If the timeout is set too short, legitimate requests may be prematurely terminated, affecting user experience.\n* Risks and tradeoffs: There is a risk of users not receiving the verification code in time due to network issues, leading to failed verifications. Implementing timeout management may add complexity to the system, requiring additional error handling and recovery mechanisms.\n* Followup decisions: Decide on the method of generating and sending the verification code (e.g., SMS, email). Implement a mechanism to track the status of sent verification codes and their expiration. Define user feedback mechanisms for expired codes and re-sending options.",

If the code is not entered within 30 seconds it is expired.': Decision: Timeout Management pattern - The Timeout Management pattern is used to handle timeouts in distributed systems, ensuring that operations do not hang indefinitely and that resources are released appropriately. It involves setting time limits on operations and defining actions to take when those limits are exceeded.\n* Clarifying questions: What specific operations are we considering for timeout management in relation to the verification code? How will the system handle the expiration of the verification code after 30 seconds? What mechanisms are in place to ensure that the verification code is sent successfully within the required time frame? Are there any user experience considerations for handling expired codes? What fallback mechanisms are in place if the SMS or email service fails to deliver the verification code?\n* Assumptions and constraints: The system must ensure timely delivery of the verification code within the specified time limits. The verification code must be securely generated and stored to prevent unauthorized access. The system must comply with relevant data protection regulations when handling user data.\n* QA consequences: The system may experience delays in user verification if the timeout management is not properly implemented, leading to user frustration. If the timeout is set too short, legitimate requests may be prematurely terminated, affecting user experience.\n* Risks and tradeoffs: There is a risk of users not receiving the verification code in time due to network issues, leading to failed verifications. Implementing timeout management may add complexity to the system, requiring additional error handling and recovery mechanisms.\n* Followup decisions: Decide on the method of generating and sending the verification code (e.g., SMS, email). Implement a mechanism to track the status of sent verification codes and their expiration. Define user feedback mechanisms for expired codes and re-sending options.",
