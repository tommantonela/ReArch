Decouples the subject from its observers, allowing for independent management of user sessions and logout functionality. 2. Supports dynamic registration and deregistration of observers, which is useful for managing user sessions as users log in and out. 3. Facilitates real-time updates to observers, ensuring that all parts of the system are aware of session changes immediately.\n* Cons: 1. Requires careful management of observer registration to avoid memory leaks if observers are not deregistered properly. 2. May introduce complexity if there are many observers, as each observer must handle state updates appropriately. 3. If not implemented efficiently, it could lead to performance issues due to excessive notifications.\n]",
